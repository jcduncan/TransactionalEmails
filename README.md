#What are Transactional Emails?
Any email sent to one person as a result of an action taken by the user - including automated notifications like welcome emails, shipping notices, order confirmations, password reminders, purchase reciepts, etc - basically anthing that isn't a bulk blast. The emails provide feedback, making sure users know that transactions have been processed.

The main idea is the adage, "you're only as strong as your weakest link," so if the user experience on the transactional email side is lacking, strengthen it.
